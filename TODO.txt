Project To Do
-------------

-   Service Security
    -   use Shiro for internal functionality
    -   use public/private key hashing for service auth
    -   redirect non-secure to secure (this should be auto in real server so may be able to neglect in dev)

    -   apikey is the common key value shared across all users (generated and stored in the app)
        -   will need a means of providing it to users
        -   this is the password for the "service" user

    -   sessionkey is the user-specific, session-specific
        -   combination of apikey, user/pass, and session generated key

    -   Client "login"
        -   client sends login request with: username, password, apikey
        -   server authenticates user and returns sessionkey and sessionid

        request comes in and is authenticated as the service user using the api_key as password
        if authenticated the service users is upgraded to runAs the user specified by the userid (if the userid exists)

    -   Standard request
        1.  client creates request
        2.  client creates hash of request data
            -   apikey + sessionkey + request_params + request_body + timestamp
        3.  client sends request with hash, sessionid, other request data, timestamp
        4.  server receives the request
        5.  server checks the timestamp of the request and rejects if too old
        6.  server uses the sessionid to find the sessionkey
        7.  server generates its own hash of the same data
        8.  server compares the hash with its version
            -   if ok, allow request
                -
            -   if not, respond with error content


-   formatting rules

-   setup db realm

-   crash setup
    -   for some reason there are classloader issues when I try to integrate the crash server

-   project analysis and reporting
-   maybe break down packages by functional area

-   consider template framework like tiles or whatever grails uses


Tomcat Stuff

-   remember me is setup but not deeply used
